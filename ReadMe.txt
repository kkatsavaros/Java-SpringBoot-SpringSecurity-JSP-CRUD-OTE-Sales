This is my project OTE Sales.
I use that programm daily in my work to read, update my customers.

At the back end i use SpringBoot and Spring Security also.
At the frond end i use JSP pages, CSS and Bootstrap.

We can also register a new user, and the most important is that the user can fetch only the records connecting with that user.

The programm also uses bcrypt encryption.

One of the main features is that the users the password and the roles is in the database.

The password also uses bcrypt encryption.

The users table with the roles table has a relationship many to many.


**** The database does not contains personal data, only some dummy data ****
